      <h1>Project: Pecha Kucha</h1>
      <p>This project aimed to have us conduct research on a personality as part of a national competition between students.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
      <p>We had to choose a person who had been deprived of freedoms and who fought to reclaim them. We then had to write a first-person narrative tracing their journey, explain our choice, and reflect on what we ourselves would be willing to do to defend our freedoms. For my part, I chose Captain Paul Watson.</p>
      <p>We also had to create an oral presentation of the <strong>Pecha Kucha</strong> type on this person.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>This project improved my research, storytelling, and public speaking skills. It also led me to reflect on fundamental personal values such as freedom and commitment.</p>
