      <h1>Project: JavaScript Website - Airbnb</h1>
      <p>This project was completed in a group of four as part of our training in the VCOD specialization. It aimed to practice our JavaScript development skills and deploy a website via GitHub Pages.</p>

      <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
      <p>We had to design a website on the theme of Airbnb accommodations in the Île-de-France region. Several criteria had to be met, including the exclusive use of the <strong>Plotly</strong> library for creating charts. The website had to include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A dashboard page containing several global indicators;</li>
        <li>A page with choropleth maps;</li>
        <li>A page with small multiples type charts.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Implementation</h2>
      <p>To organize our work, we distributed the pages among team members: each was assigned a specific page, and two of us collaborated on the dashboard. Once development was complete, we integrated all parts into a common website. To innovate in our presentation, we also integrated our PowerPoint presentation directly into the site.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>This project allowed us to consolidate our JavaScript, data visualization, and team project management skills. Despite a very tight deadline, we managed to deliver a functional, well-structured, and interactive website. This time constraint taught us to better prioritize tasks and work efficiently under pressure.</p>
