      <h1>Project: Grade Manager</h1>
      <p>This project, completed in first year as part of a SAE, aimed to practice our VBA development skills. It was initially meant to be completed in a duo, but I had to do it alone.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
      <p>We had to develop an Excel/VBA application allowing the user to enter grades and know if they were passing the year. They should be able to add, modify, and delete grades using automated macros.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>The project focused on managing academic results. The user interacted with a grade table via an Excel interface enhanced with VBA features, designed to facilitate adding and updating data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Difficulties Encountered</h2>
      <p>The main difficulty was having to carry out the project alone, which required strict organization and more time investment. Another constraint was managing different versions of Microsoft Office, which caused compatibility issues with VBA macros.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Despite these challenges, this project allowed me to gain independence and strengthen my VBA development skills. I learned to create a complete application with useful macros while adapting to real technical constraints. It was both a formative and rewarding experience.</p>
