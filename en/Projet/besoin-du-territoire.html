      <h1>Project: SAE - Territory Needs</h1>
      <p>This SAE aimed to involve us in a larger-scale project beyond the university framework.</p>

      <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
      <p>We had to choose a project from a proposed list (development of IT tools or teaching statistics and computer science concepts). Groups were formed according to individual choices. I chose to teach a first-year NSI computer science class at Paul Guérin high school. The course covered the basics of web development, allowing them to discover HTML, CSS, some JavaScript, and PHP languages.</p>
      <p>We taught classes to two groups of approximately 15 students with very heterogeneous levels.</p>

      <h2>Course Organization</h2>
      <p>We had three two-hour sessions with each group, including one three-hour session organized at the IUT. We were three students and decided to participate in all sessions while dividing responsibility for each course. To prevent sessions from becoming too long or theoretical, we favored a practical approach. On average, each session had 15 to 20 minutes of theory, with the rest of the time dedicated to hands-on computer exercises.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>This project allowed us to introduce the BUT Data Science program to future IT students while showcasing our teaching skills. It also taught us to present our work to different audiences, with two final presentations: one in English and one in French. Finally, we developed our ability to manage time and adapt to students' different levels and learning paces.</p>
