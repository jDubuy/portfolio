      <h1>Project: SAE - Data Integration in a Data Warehouse</h1>
      <p>This project was completed in a group of four as part of our training. It aimed to introduce us to automated processing of different types of data, creating an Oracle database, and its exploitation.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Practice our data processing skills.</li>
        <li>Create and manage an Oracle database with Docker Desktop.</li>
        <li>Automate Data Warehouse creation.</li>
        <li>Import data into a data visualization application.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>We had to create a Data Warehouse from data about sports products sold worldwide, following these requirements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Follow the MCD provided by the instructor.</li>
        <li>Process different file types (CSV, Excel, Access, TXT).</li>
        <li>Use a Docker Desktop environment.</li>
        <li>Provide a Power BI output composed of ten dashboards.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Difficulties Encountered</h2>
      <p>The greatest challenge of this project was learning Docker Desktop, a tool we had never used before. Its configuration and learning curve required significant adaptation time.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Overall, this project went well. Apart from discovering Docker, we did not encounter major difficulties. It allowed us to strengthen our data processing skills and diagnose many common anomalies found in databases. It was an enriching experience, both technically and collaboratively.</p>
