      <h1>Project: Creating a Website with Database Interaction</h1>
      <p>This project was completed in a group of three as part of our computer science training. It aimed to introduce us to synchronization between a website developed in PHP and a MySQL database using EasyPHP-MyAdmin.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Put our web development skills into practice.</li>
        <li>Research or imagine a relevant database.</li>
        <li>Create and manage this database with EasyPHP-MyAdmin.</li>
        <li>Develop the website as a team by sharing tasks via SharePoint.</li>
        <li>Implement multiple interactions between the website and the database.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>We had some freedom in choosing the topic, while respecting strict requirements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Users should be able to add or modify certain information in the database.</li>
        <li>The website must contain charts in JavaScript.</li>
        <li>A table must dynamically populate from database data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The topic we chose was a website listing statistics for several NBA players, allowing them to be compared. It was also possible to create a custom player and simulate their career match by match. Each user had their own account, stored in the database, so they could retrieve their custom player.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Difficulties Encountered</h2>
      <p>Overall, we did not encounter major problems in our internal group organization or in the topic choice. However, our main difficulty was our ambition regarding the career simulation feature: this functionality took us a lot of time, at the expense of finalizing and optimizing other parts of the website.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>I am generally satisfied with our production. Although time management was not optimal, the final result and each team member's personal investment demonstrate our commitment to this project. I am proud of the work accomplished, both technically and collaboratively.</p>
