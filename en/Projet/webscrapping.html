      <h1>Project: SAE Data Collection</h1>
      <p>This project was completed in a group of four students as part of our training. Its objective was to introduce us to processing data from a website or API.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a map from an API.</li>
        <li>Generate charts from data obtained from this API.</li>
        <li>Extract information from a web page.</li>
        <li>Produce charts from extracted data.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>For this project, we used <strong>Python</strong> and divided our group into two teams. The first was responsible for API management and had to produce a map of residential energy consumption for the cities of La Rochelle, Angoulême, Poitiers, and Niort, as well as an associated chart. The second team had to choose a web page containing geographic information, extract the data, and create a map. We chose the Wikipedia page on European volcanoes, from which we created several charts.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Overall, the project went well and we encountered no major difficulties. It allowed us to better understand how APIs work, as well as discover Python modules for extracting data from web pages.</p>
